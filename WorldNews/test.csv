0,Africa,1," In pictures Turning the iconic Ghana Must Go bag into high fashion.By Nduka OrjinmoBBC News, Abuja Nigerian photographer Obinna Obioma is using creative ways to display an iconic West African plastic bag to reflect on migration. Since then, no-one has asked to be given that woven matted bag at the market, they just ask for a Ghana Must Go - a phrase that is also used in Ghana, despite the painful memories it stirs for some. I remember questioning my parents and other older relatives about the origin of the bags as I found it to have an interesting name, said Obioma, who is based in New York. There s also a gele headpiece which is traditionally identified as an African fashion statement, he said. The Ghana Must Go bag has come a long way, including a ban imposed in 2017 by KLM and Air France, who said it could unravel and so clog up baggage delivery systems. The bag is also associated in Nigeria with being used by corrupt politicians to carry cash, especially during elections. But Ghana Must Go bags are still very popular across West Africa and now come in different sizes and colours, from a yellow tree-patterned one to an ugly but durable grey favoured by traders of second-hand shoes. Obioma however wonders if it is time to drop the Ghana Must Go moniker. I believe Ghana Must Go can be categorized as a derogatory slur which of course transcends Ghanaian nationals."

2,Australia,3," Australian soldiers could face prosecution and medals stripped as an SAS squadron is disbanded.Australian special forces soldiers allegedly committed 39 murders in Afghanistan, and 19 current or former soldiers will face possible prosecution and the stripping of their medals after the findings of an exhaustive defence inquiry exposed a culture of cover-ups and deceit. The alleged murders referred to by the Brereton report date back to 2006 but the majority took place in 2012 and 2013 and were committed by soldiers from the Perth-based SAS. The four-year inquiry by NSW Supreme Court Of Appeal Justice Paul Brereton found there was credible information about 23 incidents during which Australian special forces soldiers were involved in the murder of one or more non-combatants or individuals who had been captured or injured.

Chief of the Defence Force, General Angus Campbell. The Brereton report also found evidence that junior soldiers were required by their patrol commanders to shoot a prisoner to achieve their first kill, in a practice known as blooding . General Campbell said the ADF was rightly held to account for allegations of grave misconduct by some members of our special forces community on operations in Afghanistan . Apologising to both the Australian and Afghan people, he said Justice Brereton s report details credible information regarding deeply concerning allegations of unlawful killings by some but asked Australians to remember and have faith in the many . General Campbell said the problems started with a self-centred warrior culture inside the SAS, which had a misplaced focus on prestige, status and power, turning away from the regiment s heritage of military excellence fused with the quiet humility of service ."
3,Australia,4," Hong Kong Eyes will be plucked out, China warns West.China has strongly rebuked the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada after being accused of a concerted effort to silence critics in Hong Kong.

They also accused Beijing of undermining the rights of people in Hong Kong to elect their representatives.

12,Germany,13," Coronavirus Can Germany s infection protection law be compared to the Nazis Enabling Act Anti-lockdown protesters have compared the Infection Protection Law, proposed by Angela Merkel s government, to the law that paved the way for Adolf Hitler s dictatorship in 1933. But the two laws are hardly comparable. He was referring to crowds of protesters gathering outside the parliament building. Their goal was to stop the new infection protection law, intended to make it easier for the government to swiftly introduce lockdown measures in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. But tolerance can not go so far to accept that the infection protection law is being equated with the beginning of the Nazi dictatorship, with the Enabling Act of 1933. They claim the new law will give the government dictatorial powers, drawing a parallel to events in 1933. It was the self-abolition of parliament. To compare today s Infection Protection Law to the legislation pushed through back then is purely demagogical, Wirsching said. Read more How Germany s federal system impacts the fight against coronavirus Yet, today s Infection Protection Law does indeed transfer some legislative power from the parliament to the executive, the government. The infection protection law will now create a legal basis for the government to restrict some fundamental rights enshrined in the German constitution in its attempt to fight the pandemic."

Mr Rao s lawyer told the Bombay High Court on Wednesday that her client was bed-ridden, has no medical attendant and has a catheter which has not been changed for three months . The court asked the government how it could say that we will treat him in jail when Mr Rao was very ill . The court said Mr Rao should be moved to a private hospital and his treatment should be paid for by the government. It also allowed Mr Rao s family and relatives to visit him in hospital.

16,Indonesia,17," Pompeo became the first US secretary of state to visit Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, Palestine, calling it an act of provocation. This policy was changed by Secretary Pompeo. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday 19 11 became the first senior US official to visit Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Secretary Pompeo s visit to the Jewish settlement area of Psagot comes one year after he said that building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories was not a violation of international law. The voice of the international community has been rejected by Israel. It is an act of provocation, be it a visit to the Psagot settlement in the heart of the West Bank which is supposed to be part of a future Palestinian state, or a visit to the Golan Heights which is part of Syria occupied and annexed by Israel. Secretary Pompeo s statement a year ago, recognizing Jewish settlements in the occupied territories as legal settlements, angered Palestinians. They oppose any construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, territories that will become part of a future Palestinian state. In addition to Psagot, Pompeo continues to visit the occupied Golan Heights. In 1981, Israel annexed the territory."

I d tasted Psagot wines a few times in my brief forays into the world of wine journalism.

The new findings suggest that the immune system can remember the virus for years, and most people may be protected from severe COVID-19 for a substantial time, said study leaders Shane Crotty and Alessandro Sette.

Of the 10 participants who had severe COVID-19, only one had received the vaccine. Respiratory muscle damage linked to severe COVID-19 Critically ill COVID-19 patients develop virus-induced damage of respiratory muscles, scientists at Amsterdam UMC in The Netherlands reported on Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. They performed autopsy studies of the diaphragm, the main respiratory muscle, in 26 COVID-19 patients who died in the intensive care unit ICU and 8 ICU patients who died without COVID-19. The researchers found genetic evidence of the virus in diaphragm muscle cells in some of those who died from COVID-19, and microscopy analyses showed much more connective tissue scarring fibrosis in COVID-19 patients diaphragms, indicating damage, study coauthor Coen Ottenheijm told Reuters. He said the diaphragm damage may help explain why it is often difficult for COVID-19 patients to breathe on their own again after they have been on mechanical ventilators in the ICU. It may also explain the persistent shortness of breath in patients recovering from COVID-19. And some may have also had COVID-19, making their medical condition more severe."

There is no doubt that the creation of new crimes is the responsibility of the RA in the first line, and it can also be the Government s responsibility, but only with authorization from the RA he adds. It concludes, therefore, that the Government was not shown to be able to define criminal matters so the rule of the decree that defines the violation of mandatory confinement as a crime is wounded by organic unconstitutionality and is invalid . The court emphasizes that, looking at the content of the resolution of the Assembly of the Republic of March 18 that authorized the President of the Republic to declare a state of emergency, it does not withdraw from it that contains an authorization for the Government to create a new type of crime ."
