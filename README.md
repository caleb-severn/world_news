# Intro 
This repository contains my code that runs my caleb-severn.github.io website.
Visit website https://caleb-severn.github.io to see the output.

# World News
Contains the codes responsible for scraping news from around the world, cleaning, summarising, sentiment analysing, and pushing it to the github repo.
Nearly all the files are contained there, however they will not be the updated files, the updated versions are on my server or visible at my website.

# Word-2-Vec
Contains all my codes for running the w2v api, the W2V pickle file is too large to be stored on github. Might add the training and creating the training data
files at a later point.

# Code Tests
Contains my codes that I write for things like Leetcode, and Hackajob.
